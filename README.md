In the Clinical BCI Competition, two approaches was used in the prediction.  
The Single Electrode Energy (SEE) was used in the subjects P01, P02, P03, P04, P05, P07, P08, P09, and P10, and the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) was used in the subject P06.  
The folder "FBCSP" has the code used in the subject P06 and the folder "SEE" has the code used in the anothers.  
Within each folder has another README file explaining how to run the code.
